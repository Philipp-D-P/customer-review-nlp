# Natural language processing of customer reviews

This project aims to predict the star rating through text ratings from Thomann customers. A training dataset is generated based on web scraping techniques. The data was used to create a model that can predict an associated star rating for each text rating in the range of 1 to 5. As a result, it was found that prediction of stars by text ratings is well possible.
